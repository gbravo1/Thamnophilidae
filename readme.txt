Gustavo A. Bravo â€“ Thamnophilidae Dataset

This folder contains several files that contain trait data for the family Thamnophilidae. There are minor data cleaning issues taht I will address soon, but things are in good shape to run analyses.

The files contained here are as follows:

1. Thamnophilidae_T400.tree: UCE-based species-level phylogeny of the Thamnophilidae.
2. ecological_traits_by_species.txt: Categorical data describing habitat, forest strata, and foraging behavior for every species. This file in particular will be updated soon.
3. females_vocalizations_by_species.txt: Average values for frequency- and time-based vocal traits describing loudsongs of females. 
4. males_vocalizations_by_species.txt: Average values for frequency- and time-based vocal traits describing loudsongs of males.
5. morpho_by_species.txt: Average values for 10 morphometric traits describing bill, wing, tail, tarsus, and feet morphology of antbirds. 
6. plumage_specs_by_species.txt: Average values for spectrometric color measurements of different body regions in both males and females. 
7. rates_and_distribution_by_species.txt: Species-level estimates of diversification rates and age for all antbirds. Also, maximum and mid latitute and elavation values for each species range. Finally, percentage of each species range occurring in Amazonia, Andes, Dry Diagonal, Atlantic Forest, and Northern South America/Central America. The Dry Diagonal here includes Cerrado, Caatinga, Chaco, and Pampas.
8. ComparingTree_vs_data.R: R-script to read files and check how well each datasets matches the tree.

Details describing each variables will be added soon.
